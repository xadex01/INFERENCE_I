Understanding these concepts is fundamental to becoming proficient in statistical analysis. 1.1 Sources of Data Statistical data can be sourced from various places, including: Official Records: Government agencies, such as the National Bureau of Statistics, provide data on demographics, economics, and other fields. These records often include census data, labor statistics, economic indicators, and more, collected through official surveys and administrative records. Surveys: Surveys conducted by organizations or researchers collect data directly from respondents. Surveys can be conducted through various means, including online questionnaires, telephone interviews, or in-person interviews. They are often used to gather opinions, preferences, behaviors, and other information from specific populations. Experiments: Data from controlled experiments provide valuable insights into cause-and-effect relationships. In experimental studies, researchers manipulate one or more variables and observe the effects on other variables. This type of data collection is common in scientific research, clinical trials, and social experiments. Observations: Data can also be collected through direct observation of phenomena. Observational studies involve observing and recording data without interfering with the subjects. This method is commonly used in fields such as anthropology, ecology, and sociology to study natural behavior and phenomena. Secondary Sources: Secondary sources involve using data that has already been collected and published by other sources. This can include academic journals, research reports, books, and online databases. Secondary data analysis allows researchers to leverage existing data for new insights or to validate findings from primary research. Sensor Data and Internet of Things (IoT): With the advancement of technology, data generated from sensors and IoT devices have become significant sources of information. These data sources provide real-time or near-real-time data on various aspects of the environment, infrastructure, health, and more. Each source of data has its advantages and limitations, and researchers must carefully consider the appropriateness and quality of the data for their analysis. 1.2 Defining a Common Language Data is a collection of a number of pieces of information. Each specific piece of information is called an observation. The observations are measurements of certain characteristics which we call “variables”. The word “variable” is used because the pieces of information, the observations, vary from one person to the next. Types of Data 1.2.1 Example Variables Consider the following variables: \\[ \\begin{array} \\textbf{Number} &amp; \\textbf{Variable} &amp; \\textbf{Type of Variable} \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; \\text{Which are you? Near-sighted,} &amp; Categorical \\\\ &amp;far-sighted, neither\\\\ 2 &amp; \\text{What is your height?} &amp; \\text{Measurement and Continuous} \\\\ 3 &amp; \\text{How many phone calls did you make } &amp; \\text{Measurement and Discrete} \\\\ &amp; \\text{yesterday on a cell phone?}\\\\ 4 &amp; \\text{What is your cholesterol level?} &amp; \\text{Measurement and Continuous} \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Hopefully, you find the classification of the first three variables easy to understand. Variable #1 is a categorical variable because the possible choices are “words” or “categories.” Variable #2 is a measurement variable because the possible choices are “numbers.” This variable is also called a continuous variable because it can assume a range of values on a continuum. You need an instrument, such as a tape measure or a ruler, to determine height. With measurement variables that are continuous, it is often necessary to use an instrument to determine the value of the variable. Measurement variables that are continuous can be subdivided into fractional parts (subdivided into smaller and smaller units of measurement). Typically, a continuous measurement variable is expressed as “an amount of” something. Variable #3 is a measurement variable because the possible choices are numbers. It is also a discrete variable because one can simply count the number of phone calls made on a cell phone in any given day. The possible numbers are only integers such as 0, 1, 2, …, 50, etc. (Some of you probably make a lot of cell phone calls.) Discrete measurement variables cannot be subdivided into smaller and smaller fractional parts (smaller and smaller units of measurement). Often, a discrete measurement variable is expressed as “a number of” something. Variable #4 is somewhat ambiguous. Obviously what the variable is measuring (cholesterol levels) can be expressed on a continuum of possible values - but subjects are likely to round off or only know their levels as a discrete value. Cholesterol levels must be determined by a blood test where an instrument is used to determine the final value. The reported value represents the concentration of cholesterol in the blood. The appropriate units are milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). What typically happens is that the value of the cholesterol level is rounded to the nearest whole number. Consequently, the cholesterol level might look like a discrete variable - but the raw values are continuous and, since the amount of “discreteness” is not great, a variable like this would be treated the same way as a continuous variable in any analyses. Sampling Unit: The individual person, animal, or object that has the measurement (observation) taken on them/it Population: The entire group of individuals or objects that we wish to know something about. A numerical characteristic of the population is called a parameter. Sampling Frame: The list of the sampling units from which those to be contacted for inclusion in the sample is obtained. The sampling frame lies between the population and sample. Ideally, the sampling frame should match the population, but rarely does because the population is not usually small enough to list all members of the population. Sample: Those individuals or objects who provide the data to be collected. Numerical characteristics of the sample are called statistics and are typically used as estimates of population parameters. Relationship between Population, Sampling Frame and Sample 1.3 Types of Data Data can be classified into two main types: primary data and secondary data. 1.3.1 Primary Data Primary data is collected firsthand by the researcher for a specific purpose. It is original and directly obtained from the source. 1.3.2 Secondary Data Secondary data is collected by someone else for a purpose other than the researcher’s current need. It is already available and can be obtained from sources such as government agencies, research organizations, or published literature. 1.3.3 Examples Primary Data: Conducting interviews, surveys, experiments, or observations directly. Secondary Data: Using existing datasets from government agencies, academic journals, or industry reports. 1.4 Collection Methods Data collection methods vary depending on the source and nature of the data: Surveys: Questionnaires or interviews are commonly used to collect data from individuals or groups. Experiments: Controlled conditions are set up to manipulate variables and observe their effects. Observational Studies: Researchers observe and record data without interfering with the subjects. 1.5 Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Common descriptive statistics include: Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, and mode. Measures of Dispersion: Range, variance, and standard deviation. 1.5.1 Measures of Central Tendency We will focus on measures of central tendency. Measures of central tendency provide a summary of the central or typical value in a dataset. Understanding these measures is crucial for analyzing and interpreting data effectively. Measures of central tendency, also known as central location measures, are statistical measures that provide a single value to describe the center or typical value of a dataset. The three primary measures of central tendency are: Mean: The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. It is sensitive to extreme values, making it less robust in the presence of outliers. Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. Unlike the mean, the median is not influenced by extreme values, making it more robust. Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be determined for both numerical and categorical data. 1.5.2 Mean The mean, denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\) (pronounced as “x bar”), is the arithmetic average of a set of values. It is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \\] where \\(x_i\\) represents each individual value and \\(n\\) is the total number of values. 1.5.2.1 Example Consider the following dataset: \\(X = \\{10, 15, 20, 25, 30\\}\\). To find the mean: \\[\\bar{x} = \\frac{10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30}{5}\\] \\[= \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\] So, the mean of the dataset \\(X\\) is \\(20\\). 1.5.2.2 Example Consider the following dataset representing the exam scores of 10 university students: \\[ \\begin{array} \\textbf{Student ID} &amp; \\textbf{Exam Score} \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; 78 \\\\ 2 &amp; 85 \\\\ 3 &amp; 92 \\\\ 4 &amp; 67 \\\\ 5 &amp; 71 \\\\ 6 &amp; 88 \\\\ 7 &amp; 79 \\\\ 8 &amp; 84 \\\\ 9 &amp; 90 \\\\ 10 &amp; 95 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] To compute the mean exam score, we’ll follow these steps: Add up all the exam scores. Divide the total by the number of students. Let’s calculate the mean: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Total exam scores} &amp;= 78 + 85 + 92 + 67 + 71 + 88 + 79 + 84 + 90 + 95 \\\\ &amp;= 829 \\end{align*} \\] There are 10 students in total. So, the mean exam score (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) is: \\[\\begin{align*} \\bar{x} &amp;= \\frac{829}{10} \\\\ &amp;= 82.9 \\end{align*}\\] Thus, the mean exam score for these university students is \\(82.9\\). 1.5.3 Median The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. 1.5.3.1 Example Consider the dataset: \\(Y = \\{12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35\\}\\). The median is \\(20\\), as it is the middle value. Consider another dataset: \\(Z = \\{10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35\\}\\). The median is the average of the two middle values, which is \\(\\frac{20 + 25}{2} = 22.5\\). 1.5.4 Example Consider the following dataset representing the exam scores of 12 university students: \\[ \\begin{array} \\textbf{Student ID} &amp; \\textbf{Exam Score} \\\\ 1 &amp; 78 \\\\ 2 &amp; 85 \\\\ 3 &amp; 92 \\\\ 4 &amp; 67 \\\\ 5 &amp; 71 \\\\ 6 &amp; 88 \\\\ 7 &amp; 79 \\\\ 8 &amp; 84 \\\\ 9 &amp; 90 \\\\ 10 &amp; 95 \\\\ 11 &amp; 62 \\\\ 12 &amp; 93 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] To compute the median exam score, we’ll follow these steps: Arrange the exam scores in ascending order. If the number of scores is odd, the median is the middle value. If the number of scores is even, the median is the average of the two middle values. Let’s calculate the median: First, arrange the exam scores in ascending order: \\(62, 67, 71, 78, 79, 84, 85, 88, 90, 92, 93, 95\\). Since there are 12 scores (an even number), the median is the average of the 6th and 7th scores. The 6th and 7th scores are \\(84\\) and \\(85\\), respectively. \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Median} &amp;= \\frac{84 + 85}{2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{169}{2} \\\\ &amp;= 84.5 \\end{align*}\\] Thus, the median exam score for these university students is \\(84.5\\). 1.5.5 Mode The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). 1.5.5.1 Example Consider the dataset: \\(W = \\{10, 15, 20, 20, 25, 30, 30\\}\\). The mode of \\(W\\) is \\(20\\) and \\(30\\), as they both appear twice, making \\(W\\) bimodal. 1.5.5.2 Example Consider the following dataset representing the exam scores of 15 university students: \\[ \\begin{array} \\textbf{Student ID} &amp; \\textbf{Exam Score} \\\\ 1 &amp; 78 \\\\ 2 &amp; 85 \\\\ 3 &amp; 92 \\\\ 4 &amp; 67 \\\\ 5 &amp; 71 \\\\ 6 &amp; 88 \\\\ 7 &amp; 79 \\\\ 8 &amp; 84 \\\\ 9 &amp; 90 \\\\ 10 &amp; 85 \\\\ 11 &amp; 85 \\\\ 12 &amp; 88 \\\\ 13 &amp; 95 \\\\ 14 &amp; 90 \\\\ 15 &amp; 85 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] To compute the mode exam score, we’ll identify the score that appears most frequently. Let’s calculate the mode: Count the frequency of each score. Identify the score(s) with the highest frequency. The frequency distribution of exam scores is as follows: \\[ \\begin{array} \\textbf{Exam Score} &amp; \\textbf{Frequency} \\\\ 78 &amp; 1 \\\\ 85 &amp; 4 \\\\ 92 &amp; 1 \\\\ 67 &amp; 1 \\\\ 71 &amp; 1 \\\\ 88 &amp; 2 \\\\ 79 &amp; 1 \\\\ 84 &amp; 1 \\\\ 90 &amp; 2 \\\\ 95 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] The mode is \\(85\\) since it appears most frequently (4 times). Thus, the mode exam score for these university students is \\(85\\). 1.6 Measures of Dispersion - Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation Measures of dispersion quantify the spread or variability of a dataset. Understanding these measures is essential for assessing the variability of data points around the central tendency. In this lecture, we’ll cover the range, variance, and standard deviation, along with their formulas and practical examples. 1.6.1 Range The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. 1.6.1.1 Formula: \\[ \\text{Range} = \\text{Maximum Value} - \\text{Minimum Value} \\] 1.6.1.2 Example: Consider the following dataset: \\(X = \\{10, 15, 20, 25, 30\\}\\). To find the range: \\[ \\text{Range} = 30 - 10 = 20 \\] So, the range of dataset \\(X\\) is \\(20\\). 1.6.2 Variance Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean of the dataset. It provides a measure of the dispersion of data points around the mean. 1.6.2.1 Formula: \\[ \\text{Variance} (\\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n} \\] Where: - \\(x_i\\) represents each individual value, - \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean of the dataset, - \\(n\\) is the total number of values. 1.6.2.2 Example: Consider the dataset: \\(Y = \\{12, 15, 20, 25, 30\\}\\). First, find the mean: \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{12 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30}{5} = \\frac{102}{5} = 20.4 \\] Then, calculate the variance: \\[ \\text{Variance} (\\sigma^2) = \\frac{(12-20.4)^2 + (15-20.4)^2 + (20-20.4)^2 + (25-20.4)^2 + (30-20.4)^2}{5} \\] \\[ = \\frac{67.56 + 30.36 + 0.16 + 21.16 + 91.36}{5} = \\frac{210.6}{5} = 42.12 \\] So, the variance of dataset \\(Y\\) is \\(42.12\\). 1.6.2.3 Example Consider the following dataset representing the exam scores of 20 university students: \\[ \\begin{array} \\textbf{Student ID} &amp; \\textbf{Exam Score} \\\\ 2 &amp; 85 \\\\ 3 &amp; 92 \\\\ 4 &amp; 67 \\\\ 5 &amp; 71 \\\\ 6 &amp; 88 \\\\ 7 &amp; 79 \\\\ 8 &amp; 84 \\\\ 9 &amp; 90 \\\\ 10 &amp; 95 \\\\ 11 &amp; 62 \\\\ 12 &amp; 93 \\\\ 13 &amp; 75 \\\\ 14 &amp; 82 \\\\ 15 &amp; 87 \\\\ 16 &amp; 89 \\\\ 17 &amp; 83 \\\\ 18 &amp; 77 \\\\ 19 &amp; 80 \\\\ 20 &amp; 91 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] To compute the variance of the exam scores, we’ll follow these steps: Calculate the mean of the exam scores. Compute the squared difference between each exam score and the mean. Find the average of the squared differences. Let’s calculate the variance: Calculate the mean: \\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Exam Scores}}{\\text{Number of Students}} \\] \\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{1689}{20} = 84.45 \\] Compute the squared differences between each exam score and the mean: \\[ \\begin{array} \\textbf{Exam Score} &amp; \\textbf{Squared Difference} \\\\ 78 &amp; (78 - 84.45)^2 = 41.60 \\\\ 85 &amp; (85 - 84.45)^2 = 0.20 \\\\ ... &amp; ... \\\\ 91 &amp; (91 - 84.45)^2 = 42.89 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Find the average of the squared differences: \\[ \\text{Variance} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Squared Differences}}{\\text{Number of Students}} \\] \\[ \\text{Variance} = \\frac{862.55}{20} = 43.13 \\] So, the variance of the exam scores for these university students is \\(43.13\\). ### Standard Deviation The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the dispersion of data points around the mean, in the same units as the original data. 1.6.2.4 Formula: \\[ \\text{Standard Deviation} (\\sigma) = \\sqrt{\\text{Variance}} \\] 1.6.2.5 Example: To calculate the standard deviation of exam scores, we first need to compute the variance as shown in the previous example. Once we have the variance, we can take the square root of it to obtain the standard deviation. Using the same dataset of exam scores: Mean of exam scores: \\(\\bar{x} = 84.45\\) Variance of exam scores: \\(s^2 = 43.13\\) The formula to calculate the standard deviation (\\(s\\)) is: \\[ s = \\sqrt{s^2} \\] Substituting the variance value into the formula: \\[ s = \\sqrt{43.13} \\approx 6.57 \\] Thus, the standard deviation of the exam scores for these university students is approximately \\(6.57\\). 1.7 Exploring Graphs in Statistical Analysis Graphs are powerful tools for visualizing data and understanding relationships between variables. We will discuss when to use each type of graph, how best to use them, and the appropriate kind of data for each graph. 1.7.1 1. Histograms When to use: Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable. How to use: Plot the frequency distribution of data using bars. Adjust the number of bins to balance detail and smoothness. Appropriate data: Continuous numerical data, such as exam scores, heights, or weights. 1.7.2 2. Bar Charts When to use: Bar charts are used to compare the frequency or proportion of different categories. How to use: Plot bars for each category with the height representing the frequency or proportion. Ensure clear labeling and spacing between bars. Appropriate data: Categorical or ordinal data, such as survey responses, product categories, or rating scales. 1.7.3 3. Boxplot (Box-and-Whisker Plot) When to use: Boxplots are useful for displaying the distribution and identifying outliers in continuous data. They provide a visual summary of the central tendency, variability, and skewness of the data. How to use: Interpret the central line (median), box (interquartile range), and whiskers (range of data). Identify outliers using individual points. Appropriate data: Continuous data with a large number of observations, especially when comparing multiple groups. 1.7.4 4. Scatterplots When to use: Scatterplots are used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. How to use: Plot points representing individual data points with one variable on each axis. Look for patterns, trends, or correlations. Appropriate data: Paired numerical data, such as height vs. weight, temperature vs. sales. 1.7.5 5. Line Graphs When to use: Line graphs are used to display trends or changes over time. How to use: Plot data points connected by lines to show the trend. Use clear labeling and ensure a consistent time interval on the x-axis. Appropriate data: Time series data, such as stock prices, temperature over months, or sales over years. 1.7.6 6. Pie Chart When to use: Pie charts are used to display the composition of a whole and show the relative sizes of different parts. How to use: Divide the circle into slices representing different categories. The size of each slice corresponds to the proportion or percentage of the whole. Appropriate data: Categorical data with a small number of categories, where the focus is on proportions or percentages.

You might have heard that these polls often use sample sizes of around 1000 to 1500 people. But why is a sample size of around 1000 commonly used? The answer lies in understanding the concept of the margin of error. 2.2 What is the Margin of Error? You know when you’re playing a game and you try to throw a ball into a basket? Sometimes, you don’t throw the ball exactly where you want it to go. That’s kind of like what the margin of error is in surveys. The margin of error: Measures the reliability of estimates based on survey data. Decreases as the sample size increases. Doesn’t provide information about bias or other errors in a survey. For a sample size of 1000, the margin of error for a sample proportion is around 3%. Other inherent survey problems may cause biases of a percent or two, making it often not worth the expense to achieve further improvement in the margin of error by increasing the sample size further. The margin of error for most sample estimates depends directly on the square root of the sample size. For instance, having four times as many people in the sample would halve the margin of error, making the survey twice as reliable. Notably, the size of the population doesn’t affect the margin of error. 2.3 Interpretation of the Margin of Error If one obtains many unbiased samples of the same size from a defined population, the difference between the sample percent and the true population percent will be within the margin of error at least 95% of the time. It’s crucial to understand that the interpretation of the margin of error is based on what would happen if the survey were conducted repeatedly under identical conditions. The margin of error reflects the reliability of the data-gathering process. When discussing the margin of error, it’s essential to recognize that we can’t guarantee the difference between the sample percent and the population percent will always be within the margin of error for all possible samples. Hence, statisticians use the laws of probability to ensure that at least 95% of the time, this difference will be within the margin of error. 2.3.1 Understanding Margin of Error in Surveys: Gallup Emotions Report The Gallup Global Emotions Report from March 2016 looked at how people in 140 countries felt in 2015. They asked questions to learn about people’s emotions. For example, in Paraguay, they talked to about 1000 adults. They found that 84% of them said they smiled or laughed a lot the day before. Meanwhile, in Syria, they also talked to about 1000 adults, and only about 36% said they smiled or laughed a lot. Both surveys had a margin of error of about 3%. But what does that mean? 2.3.1.1 Interpretation of Margin of Error If we assume the survey was done fairly, then we can say that the difference between the percent we found and the true percent in the whole population is likely to be within 3%, about 95% of the time. So, we’re pretty confident that between 81% to 87% of adults in Paraguay smile or laugh a lot each day. Also, because our range (81% to 87%) is all above 72%, we can say we’re quite sure that the rate in Paraguay is higher than the worldwide average of 72%. In Syria, even though the population is three times bigger, the margin of error is still about 3%. But remember, the margin of error only tells us about the randomness in the survey. It doesn’t say anything about other issues like not being able to talk to everyone because of safety concerns. 2.4 Types of Research Studies Research studies can be categorized into two basic types: experiments and observational studies. 2.4.1 Experiments (Randomized Experiments) What are they? Experiments involve the researcher creating differences in the explanatory variable by assigning treatments randomly. Key Points: Allow for “cause and effect” conclusions if random assignment is used. Help minimize the impact of confounding variables. Example: Comparing the effectiveness of two teaching methods. 2.4.2 Observational Studies What are they? Observational studies involve observing differences in the explanatory variable without any random assignment of treatments. Key Points: Strive for association conclusions since “cause and effect” conclusions are not possible. May face challenges with confounding variables. Example: Studying the relationship between smoking and wrinkles. 2.5 Understanding Standard Scores Standardized scores, also known as “standard scores” or “z-scores,” help us understand where an observation stands relative to others in a dataset. 2.5.1 What are Standardized Scores? Standardized scores measure relative standing on a list by indicating the number of standard deviations above (+) or below (-) the mean a value is. These scores are computed using the formula: Standardized Score (Z-score) = (Value - Mean) / Standard Deviation The list of standardized scores always has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.0 because: Subtracting the mean from every value makes the new mean equal zero. Dividing every value by the standard deviation makes the new standard deviation equal to 1. 2.5.1.1 Example: Speedometer Suppose the gas mileage for compact SUVs in the 2013 model year has a mean of 22 mpg and a standard deviation of 3 mpg. An SUV getting 25 mpg would have a standardized score of +1, indicating it’s one standard deviation above the mean. Another SUV getting 20.5 mpg would have a standardized score of -0.5, showing it’s one-half of a standard deviation below the mean. 2.5.1.2 Example: CO2 Emissions Consider 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder cars’ CO2 emissions in the 2013 model year. A Honda Civic emitting 284 ppm would have a z-score of -1.06, while a Toyota Camry emitting 358 ppm would have a z-score of +0.77. Despite the absolute ppm difference, the Honda Civic has higher relative CO2 emissions compared to other cars with the same number of cylinders. 2.6 Understanding the Normal Curve Many natural measurement variables exhibit a predictable bell-shaped pattern known as the normal distribution. This pattern is characterized by a symmetrical distribution, with most data points clustered around the center and few on the extremes. 2.6.1 Characteristics of Normal Distribution Variables resulting from the sum or average of similar components tend to follow a normal distribution. Examples include the weights of cartons of eggs, which result from the sum of individual egg weights, and psychological measures like stress levels derived from questionnaire scores. Such measures within a homogeneous group of individuals often approximate a normal curve. 2.6.2 Examples of Normal Curves 2.6.2.1 Heights (inches) The distribution of heights among Stat 100 students resembles a normal curve. The mean height is 66.3 inches, and the median is 66 inches, indicating symmetrical distribution. Histogram of Height 2.6.2.2 Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA distribution shows slight left skewness but can roughly be approximated as normal. The upper tail of the distribution is clustered due to the capped GPA limit of 4.0. Despite the skewness, mean and median values are close, allowing for rough approximations using the normal curve. Histogram of GPA (Mean = 3.25 &amp; Median = 3.3) 2.6.2.3 Number of Tattoos The distribution of tattoos is highly skewed to the right, with most students having no tattoos. The discrete nature of the variable and the lack of a continuous range lead to gaps in the histogram. Due to the extreme skewness and discrete nature, the normal curve should not be used to make any approximations for tattoo data. 2.6.3 The Empirical Rule The empirical rule is a guideline that can be applied when you know that the sample is approximately normally distributed. The empirical rule also helps one to understand what the standard deviation represents. The empirical rule says that for any normal (bell-shaped) curve, approximately: 68%of the values (data) fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean in either direction 95%of the values (data) fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean in either direction 99.7%of the values (data) fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean in either direction ### Example: Empirical Rule In Example above, we examined the distribution of heights among Stat 100 students, finding it to be normally distributed. Now, we can apply the empirical rule to this dataset. 2.6.3.1 Dataset Details: Mean (µ): 66.3 inches Standard Deviation (σ): 4 inches 2.6.3.2 Calculations: Mean ± 1(SD) = 66.3 ± 4 inches = (62.3 to 70.3 inches) Mean ± 2(SD) = 66.3 ± 2(4) inches = 66.3 ± 8 inches = (58.3 to 74.3 inches) Mean ± 3(SD) = 66.3 ± 3(4) inches = 66.3 ± 12 inches = (54.3 to 78.3 inches) 2.6.3.3 Interpretation: Approximately 68% of heights fall between 62.3 and 70.3 inches. About 95% of heights lie within the range of 58.3 to 74.3 inches. Nearly 99.7% of heights are within the range of 54.3 to 78.3 inches. 2.6.3.4 Note: Heights smaller than 54.3 inches or taller than 78.3 inches would be very unusual within this sample. With 68% of heights within one standard deviation of the mean, the remaining 32% is distributed symmetrically, with 16% falling below 62.3 inches and 16% above 70.3 inches. Percentiles in the normal curve are determined by standardized scores, as depicted in Table 8.1 in Chapter 8 of the textbook (page 175). For example, the 23rd percentile corresponds to a standard score of z = -0.74, while the 97th percentile corresponds to z = 1.88. "],["relationships-between-measurement-variables.html", "Chapter 3 Relationships Between Measurement Variables 3.1 Graphs for Two Different Measurement Variables", " Chapter 3 Relationships Between Measurement Variables We will examine the relationship between measurement variables; how to picture them in scatterplots and understand what those pictures are telling us. The overall goal is to examine whether or not there is a relationship (association) between the variables plotted. In Lesson 6, we will discuss the relationship between different categorical variables. Variable Types and Related Graphs 3.1 Graphs for Two Different Measurement Variables In a previous lesson, we learned about possible graphs to display measurement data. These graphs included: dotplots, stemplots, histograms, and boxplots view the distribution of one or more samples of a single measurement variable and scatterplots to study two at a time 3.1.1 Example 5.1 Graph of Two Measurement Variables The following two questions were asked on a survey of 1203 STAT 100 students: What is your height (inches)? What is your weight (lbs)? Notice we have two different measurement variables. It would be inappropriate to put these two variables on side-by-side boxplots because they do not have the same units of measurement. Comparing height to weight is like comparing apples to oranges. However, we do want to put both of these variables on one graph so that we can determine if there is an association (relationship) between them. Scatterplot of Weight versus Height In Figure above, we notice that as height increases, weight also tends to increase. These two variables have a positive association because as the values of one measurement variable tend to increase, the values of the other variable also increase. You should note that this holds true regardless of which variable is placed on the horizontal axis and which variable is placed on the vertical axis.
